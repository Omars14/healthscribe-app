# n8n Workflow Setup - Medical Audio Transcription

## ‚úÖ Your Workflow Configuration

Based on your "Medical Audio Transcription - Dual Path" workflow, here's what needs to be configured:

## 1. üîß Update n8n Webhook URL

Your n8n webhook needs to be accessible. The current URL appears to be down:
- Current: `https://76e74b5ff10b.ngrok-free.app/webhook/upload`

### To get your correct webhook URL:

1. Open n8n
2. Open your "Medical Audio Transcription - Dual Path" workflow
3. Click on the **"Webhook - Receive Medical Audio"** node
4. Look for the **Production URL** or **Test URL**
5. Copy that URL

### Update your .env.local:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=<your-actual-webhook-url>
```

## 2. üìù Update Callback URL in n8n

Your n8n workflow needs to know where to send results back.

1. In n8n, open your workflow
2. Find the **"Send Transcription Result"** node (last node in the workflow)
3. Update the URL field to one of these:

### For Local Development:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/transcription-result-v2
```

### For Production:
```
https://healthscribeai.vercel.app/api/transcription-result-v2
```
(or your actual production domain)

### If using ngrok for local testing:
```
https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-app/api/transcription-result-v2
```

## 3. üîë Verify OpenAI Credentials

Your workflow uses OpenAI Whisper for transcription:

1. In n8n, go to **Credentials** (left sidebar)
2. Find **"OpenAi account"** credential
3. Make sure your OpenAI API key is set and valid
4. Test the connection

## 4. üöÄ Activate the Workflow

**IMPORTANT**: The workflow must be active to receive webhooks!

1. Open your workflow in n8n
2. Toggle the **Active** switch (top right) to ON
3. You should see a green "Active" badge

## 5. üß™ Test the Integration

Run our test script to verify everything works:

```bash
node test-n8n-integration.js
```

You should see:
- ‚úÖ n8n webhook is accessible
- ‚úÖ Callback endpoint is accessible

## 6. üìä Data Flow

Here's how your data flows through the system:

```
Your App ‚Üí n8n Webhook ‚Üí Extract URL ‚Üí Whisper ‚Üí Process Result ‚Üí Send Back to App
```

### Small Files (<2MB):
1. App sends base64 encoded audio in `body.fileContent`
2. n8n converts to binary
3. Sends to OpenAI Whisper
4. Returns transcription to your app

### Large Files (>2MB):
1. App uploads to Supabase Storage
2. Sends URL in `body.instructions.directUrl`
3. n8n fetches from URL
4. Sends to OpenAI Whisper
5. Returns transcription to your app

## 7. üîç Debugging

### Check n8n Executions:
1. In n8n, click **Executions** (left sidebar)
2. Look for recent runs of your workflow
3. Click on any execution to see details
4. Red nodes indicate errors

### Common Issues:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Webhook returns 404 | Workflow not active or URL incorrect |
| No executions appear | Check webhook URL in .env.local |
| Transcription fails | Check OpenAI API key and quota |
| Callback fails | Update Send Result node URL |
| Large files fail | Check Supabase storage configuration |

## 8. üìã Environment Variables Summary

Make sure these are set in your `.env.local`:

```env
# n8n Webhook (get from n8n webhook node)
NEXT_PUBLIC_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-n8n-url/webhook/upload

# Your app URL (for callbacks)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Supabase (already configured)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://yaznemrwbingjwqutbvb.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
```
